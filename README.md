# Concentration Game
The purpose of the game is to test your memory and ability to concentrate. It does this by selecting three images at random from twelve possibilities. Then you will be shown all available images and you have to select the three you were shown, in the sequence you were shown them.
You must get two out of three correct in order to win the game.

I initially chose this game because it was the only one that I had any nostalgia for, and becuase I immedialtey though of ways to enhance the game and improve the players experience.

### Attributions: 

- AI use - Copilot and Gemini - used to "peer-review" in that I compared  AI to AI, and provide suggestions and help find errors.

- Was looking for a way to control how long the images were being displayed, I found setTimeout at: [MDN setTimeout:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout)

- I was gettinng an error saying somethign was not loaded when i knew it was there and no erors, googled that and found: [DOM Content Loaded](https://dev.to/smpnjn/waiting-for-the-dom-to-be-ready-in-javascript-42l7) to wrap around the JavaScript

- Had a pic that was flashing up during the page transition, no matter what I cleared it kept popping up, so I searched making it not appear and found: [:empty pseudoclass](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)
Also, it was touched upon during out class when we did "Anatomy of a CSS selector"

### Technology Used:
1. Cascading Style Sheets
    - Button placement, color
    - Layout of images for quiz
2. JavaScript
    - Random selection of images to visual sequence
    - 
<br>

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add title graphic to image viewer, instead of jumping in to black then the first image. 
2. Add more to quiz and option of themes for images.
3. Visual sequences in sound.
4. Distrations
    - Either sound or images, depending on what type of visual sequnce the player selected, that contrast with the visual sequence.
