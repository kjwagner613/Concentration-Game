      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        This is a game about memory, and concentration. You will be shown three images, picked at random from twelve
        available optons. They will only be up a fraction of a second, and they will not be shown again.
      <p>
      <p>Remember the images and the sequence in which you saw them. After you are presented with your three images, a
        grid of all twelve will be laid out to test your recall.
        As soon as the quiz of twelve images have been laid out, begin selecting the images that look like yours, and in
        the same order that you saw them.
        When you click your images, make sure you see the button activate, which can be confirmed by the border of the
        picture turning blue.</p>
      <p>You must select at least two images in their correct position, and make your selections in under TEN SECONDS to
        win.
        You can not change your selection once made. Your results will be displayed after you have clicked on your third
        image, or when your ten seconds are up.</p>
      <p>If you would like to play again, just click the Play Again button at the end. When you're ready to begin, go
        ahead and click the Start Game button below. </p>
      <p>Hint: Ten seconds is not long, when you're looking for the images in the quiz, remember the locations of the
        others on the way.
        Be ready! The game begins as soon as you click that button.</p>
      <p class="instruct-p">Have fun.</p>
